My name is Lauren, and I am an NSERC CGS-M funded Ph.D student in the [Memory and Perception Lab](https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto, supervised by Dr. Morgan Barense. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my Honours Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Waterloo in 2022. My undergraduate honours thesis (supervised by Dr. Daniel Smilek) investigated how self-selected background music influenced task performance and subjective attentional engagement (i.e., task focus, mind wandering, and external distraction states), as well as how this relation may change depending on task demands and time-on-task. 

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy playing the violin and piano, skiing, travelling, and practicing my barista skills with my home espresso set up.
