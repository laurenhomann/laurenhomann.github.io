Hi there! I'm **Lauren**, a Ph.D. student fascinated by how humans perceive, learn, and remember. I am funded by NSERC and work in the [Memory and Perception Lab](https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of [Dr. Morgan Barense](https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/morgan-barense).

Some of my current research directions, incorporating behavioural, neuroimaging, and computational approaches, include:

- **Transforming Memory Through Retrieval**  
  I characterize how memory reactivation via retrieval influences the transformation of complex memories and their integration within the broader memory system ([check out our new preprint](https://osf.io/923rj_v2)). I also seek to examine the neural mechanisms underlying retrieval-induced memory change, the role of sleep in shaping retrieval effects, and how retrieval may contribute to the modification of self-schemas and identity.

- **Neural Dynamics of Real-World Perception**  
  I employ novel neuroimaging methods to investigate the temporal neural dynamics that support naturalistic, continuous perceptual experiences.

- **Optimizing Memory in Naturalistic Contexts**  
  I explore techniques to enhance memory for real-life events in ecologically valid settings ([check out our new preprint](https://osf.io/923rj_v2)).

I earned my Honours Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Waterloo, where my research spanned memory and attention. [My first stream of research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-023-01836-6) examined how self-selected background music influenced task performance and subjective attentional engagement (i.e., task focus, mind wandering, and external distraction states), as well as how this relation may change depending on task demands. [My second stream of research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506285.2022.2050871) sought to elucidate the distinctions in how emojis and words are represented and retrieved from memory.

When Iâ€™m not in the lab, I enjoy spending time with my cat Ladybug, playing violin and piano, biking around Toronto, camping and exploring the outdoors, and honing my barista skills with my home espresso setup.
