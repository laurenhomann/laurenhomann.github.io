My name is Lauren, and I am an NSERC CGS-M funded PhD student in the [Memory and Perception Lab](https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto, supervised by [Dr. Morgan Barense](https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/morgan-barense). 

Generally, I am interested in investigating the ways in which individuals encode, modify, and retrieve complex memories, leveraging behavioural and neuroimaging methodologies. Currently, my research explores methods of improving memory for one's personal past.

I earned my Honours Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Waterloo, where my research spanned memory and attention. My undergraduate honours thesis (supervised by [Dr. Daniel Smilek](https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/daniel-smilek)) examined how self-selected background music influenced task performance and subjective attentional engagement (i.e., task focus, mind wandering, and external distraction states), as well as how this relation may change depending on task demands. My other stream of research (supervised by [Dr. Myra Fernandes](https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/myra-fernandes)), sought to elucidate the distinctions in how emojis and words are represented and retrieved from memory.

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy playing the violin and piano, biking around Toronto, and honing my barista skills with my home espresso setup.
